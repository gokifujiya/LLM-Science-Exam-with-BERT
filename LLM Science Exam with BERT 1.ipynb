    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition involves **building a machine learning model to answer multiple-choice questions that were created by a large language model (LLM)**. The dataset consists of questions with **five possible answers (labeled A through E)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to **predict the top three most probable answers for each question in the test set**. For each question, there is one answer that is considered the most correct, according to the generating LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific files are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    train.csv: This file contains **200 example questions along with the correct answers**. This data should be used to train your machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    test.csv: This file contains the questions for which you must predict the answers. Note that the provided test.csv file is just a placeholder; the actual test data will be provided when your submission is scored. The true test data will have a similar format, but will consist of ~4,000 different questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    sample_submission.csv: This file shows the correct format for submitting your predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each question in test.csv, your model should predict the labels of the top three most probable answers, separated by spaces. These predictions should be stored in a new column called 'prediction'. The order of the labels matters, with the first label being the most likely answer according to your model, the second label being the second most likely, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **your predictions should be written to a CSV file for submission**. The submission file should have two columns: 'id' and 'prediction'. The 'id' column should match the 'id' column in test.csv, and the 'prediction' column should contain your model's predictions."

    "**The LLM needs to know the correct answer for each question** in the dataset to learn from it. In our dataset, the correct answer is given in the 'answer' column as a letter (A, B, C, D, or E). We need to **convert these letters into indices (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4)** because the LLM works with numbers."

    "This code **computes the average precision at 3 for each question, then takes the mean of these scores**. The average_precision_at_3 function returns the precision at the rank of the correct label if it is within the top 3 predictions, or 0 otherwise. It uses the index method to find the rank of the correct label, adding 1 because index is 0-based while ranks are 1-based. The try/except block handles the case where the correct label is not in the top 3 predictions."
