    "# Introduction\n",

    "This competition involves **building a machine learning model to answer multiple-choice questions that were created by a large language model (LLM)**. The dataset consists of questions with **five possible answers (labeled A through E)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to **predict the top three most probable answers for each question in the test set**. For each question, there is one answer that is considered the most correct, according to the generating LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific files are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    train.csv: This file contains **200 example questions along with the correct answers**. This data should be used to train your machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    test.csv: This file contains the questions for which you must predict the answers. Note that the provided test.csv file is just a placeholder; the actual test data will be provided when your submission is scored. The true test data will have a similar format, but will consist of ~4,000 different questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    sample_submission.csv: This file shows the correct format for submitting your predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each question in test.csv, your model should predict the labels of the top three most probable answers, separated by spaces. These predictions should be stored in a new column called 'prediction'. The order of the labels matters, with the first label being the most likely answer according to your model, the second label being the second most likely, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **your predictions should be written to a CSV file for submission**. The submission file should have two columns: 'id' and 'prediction'. The 'id' column should match the 'id' column in test.csv, and the 'prediction' column should contain your model's predictions."

This directly impacts the model's capacity to learn from data, its computational requirements, and its performance on different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "    BERT-base: BERT-base models are smaller versions, with 12 transformer layers, each with a hidden size of 768, and 12 attention heads. This results in a total of about 110 million parameters.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Because BERT-large models are larger and have more parameters, they have a greater capacity to learn and model complex patterns in data.** As a result, they typically perform better on tasks involving understanding natural language. **However, they also require more computational resources (both for training and inference), and the improvements they provide may not always justify the increased computational cost**, depending on the specific application and available resources.\n",

    "**Training LLMs from scratch is computationally expensive and can take a very long time, even on multiple GPUs**. In practice, **we often use a pre-trained LLM and fine-tune it on our specific task, which is much quicker and requires less computational resources**."
